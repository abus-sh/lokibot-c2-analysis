This is a work-in-progress reimplmentation of the LokiBot C2 communication protocol based on a
sample I have been playing with. The server currently displays information about infected computers
as it receives packets. In the future, it will also be able to send responses to the malware to act
in various ways.

Please note that this project was created for educational purposes. *Do not* use this project in any
context where you do not have full and complete permission to run this C2 server.
